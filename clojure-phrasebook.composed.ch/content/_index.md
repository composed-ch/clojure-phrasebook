The _Clojure Phrasebook_ is a concise summary of [Getting
Clojure](https://pragprog.com/titles/roclojure/getting-clojure/) by Russ Olsen
with exercises. A basic understanding of functional programming concepts
(lambdas, lexical scoping, immutability) is required. No setup instructions are
provided (yet).
