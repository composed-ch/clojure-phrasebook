**Work in Progress (7/20 Chapters)**

The _Clojure Phrasebook_ is a terse summary of [Getting
Clojure](https://pragprog.com/titles/roclojure/getting-clojure/) by Russ Olsen
with additional exercises and solutions. A basic understanding of functional
programming concepts (lambdas, lexical scoping, immutability) is required. No
setup instructions are provided (yet).
